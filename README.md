# BiteMe  
**Reviews and credible recommendations**  
#### We never buy any health product without asking our friends. Why do anything different on an e-commerce site?  
###### BiteMe is an application that focuses on **credible** user reviews when buying any health product  
  
## How to run?  
As we have not hosted our server on any online service, it must be run using a local network.  
The phone and the server should be on the same WiFi network.  
  
* Make sure your Firewall is off, to communicate between your phone and laptop.  
* Note down your laptop IP address using the following commands in your terminal:  
  
##### Windows  
```
ipconfig
```  
![Windows IP](/Screenshots/windows_ip.JPG){:height="50%" width="50%"}  
  
##### Linux  
```
ifconfig
```  
![Linux IP](/Screenshots/linux_ip.JPG){:height="50%" width="50%"}  
  
To run the server, we need the following softwares and libraries:  
1. python3.7  
1. flask  
1. fuzzywuzzy  
1. tensorflow  
1. keras  
1. numpy  
1. pandas  
1. scikit-learn  
1. nltk  
  
*Open up terminal and enter the following code:*  
```
python3.7 server.py
```  
  
###### Once this is done, we need to tell our app our IP after sign in.  
**Steps**:

![App IP](/Screenshots/app_ip.jpeg){:height="50%" width="50%"}
